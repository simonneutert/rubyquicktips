Instead of using the database-specific command to start your projectâ€™s database console, Rails provides one consistent interface for the most popular databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite):


  script/dbconsole [RAILS_ENV] # Rails 2
rails dbconsole [RAILS_ENV] # Rails 3
rails db [RAILS_ENV] # Rails 3 alias
