Instead of looping through your collection and rendering a partial for each element like this:

<% @students.each do |student| %>
<%= render :partial => ''person'', :locals => { :person => student } %>
<% end %>


â€¦you can pass the collection directly to the render method:

<%= render :partial => ''person'', :collection => @students %>


Please note that the name of the variable, you can use inside the partial to refer to each element of your collection, has the same name as your partial; and is not derived from the name of your collection. So, in this case use person and not student.

Check the API docs on render.
