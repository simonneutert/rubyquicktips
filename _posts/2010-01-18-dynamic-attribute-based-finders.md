  Dynamic attribute-based finders are a cleaner way of getting objects by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by appending the name of an attribute to find_by_, find_last_by_, or find_all_by_, so you get finders like Person.find_by_user_name, Person.find_all_by_last_name, and Payment.find_by_transaction_id.


So, instead of writing

Person.find(:all, :conditions => ["last_name = ?", last_name])


â€¦you just do

Person.find_all_by_last_name(last_name)


It is also possible to use multiple attributes by separating them with an _and_:

Person.find_by_user_name_and_password
Payment.find_by_purchaser_and_state_and_country


Taken from the ActiveRecord::Base documentation.
