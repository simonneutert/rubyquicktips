This does not work:


  class Foo
  private
  
  def self.bar
  end
end


Foo.bar will be public.
To make it private, you can use Module#private_class_method:


  class Foo
  def self.bar
  end

  private_class_method :bar
end


â€¦or define it differently:


  class Foo
  class << self
    private
        
    def bar
    end
  end
end
