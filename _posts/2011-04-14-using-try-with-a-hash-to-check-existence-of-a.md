The try method is awesome. Check the documentation.
It is usually used to call a method on an object if it exists, or return nil if it doesnâ€™t.

But sometimes, it is not used with hashes, but this also works perfectly:


  params[:search] ? params[:search][:name] : nil

# Can also be written as...
params[:search].try(:[],:name)


Clean!
