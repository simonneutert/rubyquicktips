I would like to welcome all the new visitors and subscribers.
Since the news of this blog was posted to Ruby Inside, pageviews and subscription numbers exploded!

It’s great to see all your comments and submissions coming in. That’s what I hoped for: that developers participate in this blog by discussing existing tips or submitting new ones.
So: thank you! Especially to those how already took their time to submit a tip or write a comment.

I am on vacation for 3 weeks now, so I won’t be able to respond to comments and e-mails as quickly as I did so far. Nevertheless, there still will be tips published during this 3 weeks and I have already collected a lot more drafts for future tips.
But please be patient, if your submitted tip is not published within these three weeks: it definitely will be soon!

Thanks again for all your interest and participation!

Keep the comments and submissions coming! Put me to work - make this blog awesome!
