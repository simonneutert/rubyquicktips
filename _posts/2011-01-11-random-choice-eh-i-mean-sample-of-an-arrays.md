Need a randomly chosen element from an array? Thereâ€™s a method for that!Array#choice (Ruby 1.8.7) or Array#sample (Ruby > 1.8.7):


  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].choice
=> 5        
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].sample
=> 8
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].sample(3)
=> [3,8,9]


Thanks to everyone who mentioned these methods here and here.
