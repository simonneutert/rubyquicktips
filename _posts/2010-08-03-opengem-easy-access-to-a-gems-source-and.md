If you install the OpenGem, you’ll have two handy commands available:

gem open rails will open the gem’s source code in an editor of your choice, and
gem read rails will open a browser pointed to the gem’s documentation.
This is a fabulous way to read other people’s code and learn how to make your own gems!
