When trying to track down an issue in rspec or cucumber I often use puts to quickly read the value of a variable. Sometimes, though, I forget to take the statement out and have a hard time locating the file and line number. To quickly find out exactly where the puts statement is (or any other call you are having a hard time tracking down), just open up your environment.rb file and add this:

def puts(value)
  raise ''you found a puts''
end

Now run your tests again and the overridden method will throw an error giving you a stack trace with the file and line number. Just donâ€™t forget to remove the code before you push to production. ;)
