I have collected some initial tips for this blog now and thought it would be time to write something about the blog itself. So, here we go…

Do you know these moments when you talk to fellow programmers, read a blog article or book and suddenly discover a neat, new trick you haven’t seen or used, yet?
This blog is all about this! It’s meant to collect all those little new Ruby & Rails commands and tricks you have learned about.

Don’t expect this blog to teach you about Ruby and/or Ruby on Rails from scratch, though; it’s random and intended to be used as way to quickly discover new snippets of Ruby code.

All the tips are quicktips, which means they are short, practical and mostly lack some context and detailed explanation. However, I always link to sources which explain the commands of each tip in more detail.

I constantly learn new stuff  about Ruby and Rails from the sources mentioned above and I thought it would be a good idea to share what I learned with the public, so you can benefit, too. While this is totally awesome already, it’s even better when more people participate…
